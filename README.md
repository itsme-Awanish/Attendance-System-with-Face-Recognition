## About project:-

An approrh to solve the problem related to the atttendance system we all know that the the current biometric system or the facial recognition system is not much effecient for taking the attendance, we need to relay on the external device and the user need to stand in the front of the device and put their finger on the biometric scanner or needs to stand in the front of the device to let the device scan their face but with this project my approch is to **"create the System that will detect the face and mark the attendance from the cctv itself"**. I belive that now a days their is an huge addvancement in the field of the computer vision and the deep learning and we can use this addvancement to solve the problem related to the attendance system. and ya most importantly this project is not only for the attendance system but we can use this project for the security purpose also.
considering that every office,university and school have the cctv camera installed in their premises and we can use this cctv camera to detect the face and mark the attendance from the cctv itself.
